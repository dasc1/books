- Remaining commands from Chapter 7 have been added to the end of
  lispcommands.txt.  Some of them I don't know terribly well - I need to
  experiment with them, and write each one of them up.
- The graphviz stuff worked only partially when I tried it - I should try out
  the library that I have typed, and figure out what is going wrong, and what
  isn't.
- That will take care of Ch.7 - next on to Ch.8 and Grand Theft Wumpus!

Ultimately, I want to finish the book, entering all the examples, and create a
command summary of what I have learned, created after exploring each command.
After all that is finished, I may extend some of the games that I like.
